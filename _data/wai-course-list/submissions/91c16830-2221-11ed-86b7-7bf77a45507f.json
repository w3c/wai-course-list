For the exercises, extra time is available for learners who request it. Customized adaptation is also possible for learners with very specific needs that cannot be met in a group course. In the same way, additional pedagogical engineering can be used to adapt the training to the particular needs of certain learners so that it corresponds to their possibilities and to the way they use the computer.",

  "description": "In France today, there are an estimated 4 million deaf and hard-of-hearing people, of whom approximately 80,000 use French sign language. Recognised as a real language since 2005, French sign language is rich in culture and allows people to communicate with deaf people, and beyond that, to enrich their vision and their relationship with the world.
